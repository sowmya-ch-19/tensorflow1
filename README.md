# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using TensorFlow
This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
## Dependencies
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib
* NumPy (implicitly required by TensorFlow and Matplotlib, but you might need to use it directly for data manipulation)
# Getting Started
Ensure you have Python 3 installed, along with TensorFlow and Matplotlib. You can install the required packages using pip:
`pip install tensorflow matplotlib`
# Overview of the code
The code is structured as follows:
#### 1. Import Libraries:
TensorFlow, Matplotlib for plotting, and other necessary libraries are imported.
#### 2. Data Preparation:
The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1. The class names are also defined for later use in plotting.
#### 3. Data Visualization: 
A few images from the training set are plotted to visualize what they look like.
#### 4. Model Building:
A CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers for classification.
#### 5. Model Training:
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 training data for a specified number of epochs.
#### 6. Evaluation: 
The trained model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset.


# Instructions
#### 1. Prepare Your Environment:
Ensure you have all dependencies installed.
#### 2. Run the Code:
You can run the provided code in a Python script or a Jupyter notebook. It will automatically handle the data loading, model training, and evaluation steps.
#### 3. Observe: 
Look at the plotted images, training progress, and final test accuracy to understand how well the model performs.
#### 4. Experiment: 
Feel free to tweak the model architecture, training parameters, or data preprocessing steps to see if you can improve the model's performance.


# Key Functions
*`tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()`: Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* `model.fit()`: Trains the model for a fixed number of epochs (iterations on a dataset).
* `model.evaluate()`: Returns the loss value & metrics values for the model in test mode.

# Visualization Functions
Two helper functions, `plot_image` and `plot_value_array`, are mentioned for visualization but not defined in the provided code. You should implement these functions to visualize the test images alongside their predicted labels and a bar chart showing the confidence of each class prediction.

# Conclusion
This project provides a basic introduction to image classification with CNNs using TensorFlow and Keras. By adjusting the model architecture and training parameters, you can explore the impact on the model's performance and gain practical experience with deep learning for image classification tasks.

# Note
This README assumes the presence of helper functions like `plot_image` and `plot_value_array` for visualization, which need to be defined separately. It's also tailored for educational purposes and might require adjustments for production-grade applications or more advanced experiments.
